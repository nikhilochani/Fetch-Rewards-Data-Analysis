### Sub: Insights and Questions About Our Data Quality

Hi,

I've been diving into our transactions, users, and product data to build a more comprehensive understanding of our business trends, and I noticed several patterns that could impact how we interpret our performance.

#### Data Quality Concerns:
1. **Missing Users in Transactions:** 99.48% of users in our transactions table don't appear in the users table. This significant gap makes it challenging to accurately profile our customer base. Do we store these missing user records in another system, or is this a known integration issue?

2. **Final Quantity Tracking:** Many grocery transactions show final_quantity values between 0 and 1, suggesting weight-based tracking, but the same pattern appears for non-grocery items like snacks. Understanding how final_quantity field is standardized would help better analyze purchase behavior.

3. **Transaction Data Issues:** A portion of the data contains missing barcodes, duplicate entries, and conflicting values for final_quantity and final_sale, making some records unusable. There are also transactions where purchase dates occur after scan dates, raising concerns about data capture accuracy. Could this indicate pipeline issues, scanning inconsistencies, or something else?

4. **Concerning User Growth Trend:** While Fetch saw strong year-over-year user acquisition through 2020, we experienced a sharp decline in 2023 (-42%) and 2024 (-24%). Since majority of the transaction users donâ€™t appear in the users table, the growth trend may be underestimated.

#### Additional Information Needed:
1. To better understand these data patterns, would it be possible to get access to any documentation on how user records, transactions, and barcodes are processed through our systems?
2. Lastly, understanding our financial performance trends would be valuable. Is there a way to access revenue data that would allow for YOY growth analysis in terms of actual revenue?

Let me know if you have any insights or if we should set up time to discuss. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,  
Nikhil
