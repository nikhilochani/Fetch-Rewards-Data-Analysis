# SQL Queries for Fetch Data Analysis

## Closed-ended Questions

> #### To answer the below two closed-ended questions that heavily depend on user's age, missing user information was filled in from their transactions records. Imputation approach highlighted below:
<details>
<summary><h4>Data Imputation Process for Missing User Ages</h4></summary>

Since 99.48% of users in the transactions table are not present in the users table, age data was imputed to maintain the distribution shown in the chart below, which reflects the existing user data.

SQL query for imputation:
```sql
with cte_new_users as (
    -- Identifying unique users from transactions_cleaned table that are not in users_cleaned 
    -- and capturing the earliest purchase date as created_date
    select distinct t.user_id, min(t.purchase_date) as created_date
    from transactions_cleaned t
    left join users_cleaned_copy u on t.user_id = u.id
    where u.id is null
    group by t.user_id
),
cte_age_distribution as (
	-- Calculating the percentage distribution of users across different age groups 
    -- based on the existing users_cleaned table and excluding the outliers
    select

        end as age_group,
        round(count(*) * 100.0 /

    from users_cleaned
    where age is not null and age between 11 and 80
    group by age_group
),
cte_distributed_users as (
	 -- Determining the exact number of new users to assign to each age group 
-- Logic
    --  Multiplies the percentage of each age group by the total number of missing users, which gives the exact count of users that should go into each bin.  
    --  This ensures that the new users are distributed proportionally, maintaining the same age distribution as the existing users.  
    select age_group, 
           round(percentage_of_total / 
           				100.0 * (select count(*) from cte_new_users)) as num_users

    select m.user_id, m.created_date, 
           row_number() over () as row_num
    from cte_new_users m
),
cte_assigned_users as (
    -- Assigning ages an estimated age to each new user based on row number ranking
    -- Uses the cumulative count of required users per age group to allocate ages
    select r.user_id, r.created_date,
        case 
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group = '11-20') then 15
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group in ('11-20', '21-30')) then 25
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group in ('11-20', '21-30', '31-40')) then 35
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group in ('11-20', '21-30', '31-40', '41-50')) then 45
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group in ('11-20', '21-30', '31-40', '41-50', '51-60')) then 55
            when r.row_num <= (select sum(num_users) from cte_distributed_users where age_group in ('11-20', '21-30', '31-40', '41-50', '51-60', '61-70')) then 65
            else 75
        end as estimated_age
    from ranked_cte_new_users r
)
-- Inserting the new users into the users table
insert into users_cleaned (id, age, birth_date, created_date, state, language, gender)
select 
    user_id, 
    estimated_age,
    current_date - interval '1 year' * a.estimated_age as birth_date,
    created_date,
    'unknown' as state,
    'unknown' as language,
    'unknown' as gender
from cte_assigned_users;
```

This approach ensures that the age distribution of the imputed users matches the observed distribution in the existing user data, making our age-based analysis more accurate and representative.

### 1. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?

```sql
Select p.brand,count(distinct receipt_id) as total_receipts
from transactions_cleaned t
join users_cleaned u on t.user_id=u.id
join products_cleaned p on p.barcode=t.barcode
where u.age>=21
and p.brand <> 'Unknown'
group by p.brand
order by count(distinct receipt_id) desc

### 2. What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

```sql
With cte_total_sales as
(
	Select sum(final_sale) as total_sales
	from transactions_cleaned t
	join products_cleaned p on p.barcode=t.barcode
	where trim(p.category_1)='Health & Wellness'

Select 
	case when age <13 then 'Gen Alpha'
			 when age between 13 and 28 then 'Gen Z'
			 when age between 29 and 44 then 'Millennials'
			 when age between 45 and 60 then 'Gen X'

				/(Select total_sales from cte_total_sales),2) || '%' as percentage_of_total_sales
from transactions_cleaned t
join products_cleaned p on t.barcode=p.barcode
join users_cleaned u on t.user_id=u.id
where trim(p.category_1)='Health & Wellness'
group by generation;

## Open-ended Questions

### 1. Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?

```sql
select 
    p.brand,
    sum(t.final_sale) as total_sale,
    sum(final_quantity) as total_quantity,
    count(*) as total_transactions,
    count(distinct user_id) as unique_users,
    sum(case when t.final_sale = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as transactions_with_zero_sale_value, --count of transactions for this brand that have final_quantity=0
    round((sum(case when t.final_sale = 0 then 1 else 0 end) * 100.0) / count(*),2) as zero_sale_percentage, -- % zero sale transactions
    cast((count(*) * 1.0 / nullif(count(distinct user_id), 0)) as decimal(10,2)) as transactions_per_user -- transaction frequency per user
from products_cleaned p
join transactions_cleaned t on p.barcode = t.barcode
where trim(category_2) = 'Dips & Salsa'
group by p.brand
order by total_sale desc, total_quantity desc, total_transactions desc;
```
TOSTITOS leads the Dips & Salsa category, outperforming other brands across key metrics.
<details>
<summary>Expand here to see the approach</summary>

	
| brand | total_sale | total_quantity | total_transactions | unique_users | transactions_with_zero_sale_value | zero_sale_percentage | transactions_per_user |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| TOSTITOS | 83.98 | 38.00 | 36 | 35 | 19 | 52.78 | 1.03 |
| MARKETSIDE | 53.53 | 16.00 | 16 | 16 | 3 | 18.75 | 1.00 |
| Unknown | 53.40 | 22.00 | 21 | 21 | 12 | 57.14 | 1.00 |
| PACE | 37.56 | 24.00 | 24 | 24 | 12 | 50.00 | 1.00 |
| GOOD FOODS | 36.97 | 9.00 | 9 | 9 | 6 | 66.67 | 1.00 |

Despite ~52% of transactions having zero-sale values (assumed data ingestion issue for final_sale, but valid records), it still ranks highest in total revenue and quantity sold (38 units). While transaction frequency per user remains low across brands, TOSTITOS maintains the highest total transactions and engagement, making it the category leader.

Metrics Used:  
- Primary Metrics: Total revenue, Total units sold
- Secondary Metrics: Zero-sale percentage, Transactions per user ratio

### 2. At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?

Since revenue data is not available, growth is measured based on new user acquisition year over year.

```sql
Select
	extract(year from created_date) as year,
	count(id) as total_number_of_users,
	round(100.00 * (count(id)-lag(count(id)) over(order by extract(year from created_date)))
			/lag(count(id)) over(order by extract(year from created_date)),2) as yoy_growth
from users_cleaned tu
group by year
order by year
```
